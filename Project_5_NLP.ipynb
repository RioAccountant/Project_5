              "\"Silvino Francisco (born 3 May 1946) is a South African former professional snooker player who won the 1985 British Open.\\n\\nSnooker career\\nFrancisco comes from a snooker-playing family. His brother Manuel and nephew Peter both played at a high level, Manuel having been a runner-up in the World Amateur Billiards Championship on several occasions, and Peter having risen to the world ranking of number 14.\\nFrancisco won the 1985 British Open, beating Kirk Stevens 12–9. Prior to the start of the Final match, Francisco accused Stevens of playing under the influence of drugs. Francisco was subsequently fined for the comments. The world governing body of snooker, the WPBSA, accepted that the accusation was false and it is on record that Kirk Stevens has never failed a drugs test in the history of his career. Stevens later admitted to having an addiction to cocaine.\\nHe was involved in another scandal after the 1989 Masters. After losing 5–1 to Terry Griffiths in the last-16, it was discovered that there had been heavy betting on that exact score. Francisco was arrested, but later released without charge.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nFrancisco suffered with gambling problems towards the end of his professional career, to the extent of being declared bankrupt in 1996 due to income tax arrears, having split up from his second wife who claimed his £350,000 house, and having to pay maintenance for his four children. He later took to working evenings in a friend's fish and chip shop for extra cash.\\nIn 1997, he was arrested for smuggling cannabis, and served three years in prison.\\n\\nPerformance and rankings timeline\\nCareer finals\\nRanking finals: 1 (1 title)\\nNon-ranking finals: 3 (1 title)\\nTeam finals: 1\\nAmateur finals: 4 (4 titles)\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nSilvino Francisco at snooker.org\""

He previously served as Manager of Opposition Business in the Legislative Assembly.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBorn in Townsville, he received a Bachelor of Arts in Finance and Economics from James Cook University and Macquarie University, and was admitted to the Australian Association of Accountants in 1974, being employed by Price Waterhouse in Sydney. He returned to the family station, \\\"Doncaster\\\" in Richmond, before moving to the Gold Coast in 1979, running local businesses in the area.\\n\\nPolitical career\\nLocal government\\nStevens was a councillor on Albert Shire Council from 1988 to 1995, including a brief term as mayor beginning in 1994. After the amalgamation of Albert and Gold Coast City, he was elected mayor of the latter in 1995, serving until his defeat in 1997.\\n\\nState parliament\\nStevens was elected to state parliament in 2006 as the member for Robina, succeeding former state Liberal leader Bob Quinn. At this time he was also appointed as the Shadow Minister for Public Works and Housing from 2006 to 2009, with a brief stint from 2007 to 2008 as the Shadow Minister for Information and Communication Technology.\\nIn 2008, Stevens joined the new Liberal National Party with the rest of his party. The redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election renamed his seat to Mermaid Beach; he was re-elected. And from 2009 to 2010 he was the Shadow Minister for Tourism and Fair trading, before he continued in that role as the Shadow Minister for Tourism and Racing from 2010 to 2011. From early 2011 until the election in 2012 Stevens was the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Racing.\\nWith the Liberal National Party winning the 2012 Election, Stevens became the Leader of the House of Queensland and in October 2012 the Assistant Minister to the Premier on e-government.\\nOn 11 September 2012, Stevens sparked racism claims after using the term \\\"Jihad Jackie\\\" in Parliament to describe opposition spokeswoman Jackie Trad (herself of Catholic-Lebanese heritage).  While Stevens withdrew the remark in Parliament upon urging by house speaker, he staunchly maintained using the word Jihad to describe someone of Arabic heritage, on 11 September, was nothing he needed to apologise for. He subsequently said Trad needed to \\\"harden up\\\" and had a \\\"glass jaw\\\".\\nAt a pre-polling booth on 21 January 2015, Stevens was filmed having a bizarre reaction to a journalist asking him questions about a $100 million sky rail project from Mudgeeraba to Springbrook. Stevens had previously stated he had approval from the Integrity Commissioner, but when the journalist asked Stevens for the Commissioner's advice to be released, Stevens refused to answer. When the journalist did not back down and asked how much he could make from the development, Mr Stevens then began to wave his hands and arms up and down in the journalist's face. \\\"That Mermaid Ray really lost the plot, but without saying a word,\\\" Donovan said.\\n\\\"He started doing a dance and gyrating around \\u2014 this is a Minister of the Crown, we're talking about, let me remind you.\\\"\\n\\nExternal links\\nOfficial Biography\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n          \"Silvino Francisco (born 3 May 1946) is a South African former professional snooker player who won the 1985 British Open.\\n\\nSnooker career\\nFrancisco comes from a snooker-playing family. His brother Manuel and nephew Peter both played at a high level, Manuel having been a runner-up in the World Amateur Billiards Championship on several occasions, and Peter having risen to the world ranking of number 14.\\nFrancisco won the 1985 British Open, beating Kirk Stevens 12\\u20139. Prior to the start of the Final match, Francisco accused Stevens of playing under the influence of drugs. Francisco was subsequently fined for the comments. The world governing body of snooker, the WPBSA, accepted that the accusation was false and it is on record that Kirk Stevens has never failed a drugs test in the history of his career. Stevens later admitted to having an addiction to cocaine.\\nHe was involved in another scandal after the 1989 Masters. After losing 5\\u20131 to Terry Griffiths in the last-16, it was discovered that there had been heavy betting on that exact score. Francisco was arrested, but later released without charge.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nFrancisco suffered with gambling problems towards the end of his professional career, to the extent of being declared bankrupt in 1996 due to income tax arrears, having split up from his second wife who claimed his \\u00a3350,000 house, and having to pay maintenance for his four children.
